Section: 4.30 - Stability in Damaged Condition
Flag: REG
Chunks used: 20

## Summary of REG Section 4.30: Stability in Damaged Condition

### General Requirements
- **Intact Stability**: Ships must maintain sufficient intact stability to withstand flooding of any one main compartment within the floodable length (Ref: 4.30(1)).
- **Adjacent Compartment Flooding**: If two adjacent main compartments are separated by a stepped bulkhead, stability must be adequate to withstand flooding of both compartments (Ref: 4.30(2)).
- **Subdivision Factors**:
  - For a subdivision factor of **0.5 or less but more than 0.33**, stability must withstand flooding of any two adjacent compartments (Ref: 4.30(3)).
  - For a subdivision factor of **0.33 or less**, stability must withstand flooding of any three adjacent compartments (Ref: 4.30(4)).

### Technical Specifications
- **Calculation Requirements**: Stability calculations must consider ship design characteristics and be based on the worst anticipated service condition (Ref: 4.30(5)).
- **Water Flow Restrictions**: If decks or bulkheads restrict water flow, the Administration must ensure these restrictions are accounted for in stability calculations (Ref: 4.30(6)).
- **Righting Lever Curve**: The positive residual righting lever curve must have a minimum range of **15°** beyond the angle of equilibrium, which can be reduced to **10°** under certain conditions (Ref: 4.30(7)).
- **Area Under Righting Lever Curve**: Must be at least **0.015 metre-radians** from the angle of equilibrium to either the angle of progressive flooding or **22°** (one-compartment flooding) / **27°** (two or more compartments flooding) (Ref: 4.30(8)).
- **Residual Righting Lever**: Must be obtained within the range of positive stability, considering heeling moments from passenger crowding, launching survival craft, and wind pressure (Ref: 4.30(9)).
- **Heeling Moment Calculations**: Assumptions for heeling moments include:
  - **Crowding**: Four persons per square meter, each weighing **75 kg** (Ref: 4.30(10)(a)).
  - **Launching Craft**: Fully loaded lifeboats and liferafts assumed swung out ready for lowering (Ref: 4.30(10)(b)).
  - **Wind Pressure**: Assumed at **120 N/m²** (Ref: 4.30(10)(c)).
- **Intermediate Flooding Conditions**: Maximum righting lever must be at least **0.05 metres** with a positive righting lever range of at least **7°** (Ref: 4.30(10)(d)).

### Damage Assumptions
- **Extent of Damage**: Longitudinal extent is **3 metres plus 3% of the ship's length (L)** or **11 metres**, whichever is less. For a subdivision factor of **0.33 or less**, the extent must include two consecutive main transverse watertight bulkheads (Ref: 4.30(12)(a)).
- **Transverse and Vertical Extent**: Transverse extent is **one-fifth of the breadth of the ship**, and vertical extent is from the baseline upwards without limit (Ref: 4.30(12)(b) and (c)).

### Unsymmetrical Flooding
- **Minimization**: Unsymmetrical flooding should be minimized (Ref: 4.30(13)(a)).
- **Heeling Angle**: Maximum angle of heel after flooding should not exceed **15°** (Ref: 4.30(13)(d)).
- **Equalization Time**: Time for equalization must not exceed **15 minutes** (Ref: 4.30(13)(e)).

### Final Conditions After Damage
- **Residual Metacentric Height**: Must be at least **50 mm** for symmetrical flooding (Ref: 4.30(14)(a)).
- **Angle of Heel**: Should not exceed **7°** for one-compartment flooding and **12°** for simultaneous flooding of two or more compartments (Ref: 4.30(14)(b)).
- **Margin Line**: Must not be submerged in the final stage of flooding (Ref: 4.30(14)(c)).

### Operational Procedures
- **Master's Data**: The master must be provided with data to maintain sufficient intact stability and informed of conditions affecting stability (Ref: 4.30(15)).
- **Draught Marks**: Permanent draught marks must be provided at the bow and stern, with specific visibility and placement requirements (Ref: 4.30(17)).
- **Stability Determination**: Prior to departure, the master must determine the ship's trim and stability, ensuring compliance with approved stability criteria (Ref: 4.30(20)).
- **Exemptions**: Relaxations from damage stability requirements may only be granted in exceptional cases, with the Administration's satisfaction on ship characteristics (Ref: 4.30(22)).

This summary provides a structured overview of the key requirements and specifications outlined in REG Section 4.30 regarding stability in damaged conditions, facilitating easier comprehension and application for maritime engineers.

  ❓ DEMO 5: Additional Technical Questions
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


[1/3] Processing question...
Q: What stability documentation is required for a 50m yacht carrying 20 persons under Malta PYC?

A: For a 50m yacht carrying 20 persons under the Malta Passenger Yacht Code (PYC), the following stability documentation requirements apply:

1. **General Compliance**:
   - The yacht must comply with the requirements of the International Load Line Convention, Passenger Ship classification requirements/rules of a Recognised Organisation (RO), and the Intact Stability Code 2008 (Ref: 5.1.1.1).

2. **Stability Documentation**:
   - The yacht must demonstrate compliance with the intact stability requirements as specified in the Intact Stability Code (Ref: 5.1.1.3).
   - Additionally, for damage stability, the yacht must comply with the requirements of SOLAS and/or the applicable sections of the Code (Ref: 5.1.3.1).

3. **Specific Stability Requirements**:
   - As the yacht is under 80m in length and carries more than 12 but not more than 36 passengers, it falls under the application of the Passenger Yacht Code (Ref: 2.1.1).
   - The yacht must also ensure that its hull, machinery, and all equipment are constructed and installed to be capable of regular maintenance, ensuring they are satisfactory for the yacht’s intended service (Ref: 2.1.4).

4. **Operational Limitations**:
   - The yacht's "Statement of Operational Limitations" should include maximum wind speed or 'Derived Heel Angle' and reference the vessel’s 'Sailing Operations Manual' if applicable (Ref: 11.3).

In summary, the required stability documentation for a 50m yacht carrying 20 persons includes compliance with the International Load Line Convention, Passenger Ship classification rules, the Intact Stability Code, and the relevant SOLAS damage stability requirements. Additionally, operational limitations must be documented as per the regulations.

[2/3] Processing question...
Q: What operational stability information must be available on the bridge?

A: The operational stability information that must be available on the bridge is outlined in Section 4.22 - Damage Control Information. The requirements are as follows:

1. **Plans and Booklets**:
   - There shall be permanently exhibited, or readily available on the navigation bridge:
     - Plans showing clearly for each deck and storage space the boundaries of the watertight compartments, the openings therein with the means of closure, and the position of any controls thereof (Ref: 4.22(1)(a)).
     - Booklets containing the aforementioned information shall be made available to the officers of the ship (Ref: 4.22(1)(b)).

2. **Watertight Doors**:
   - Watertight doors in passenger ships permitted to remain open during navigation shall be clearly indicated in the ship’s stability information (Ref: 4.22(2)).

3. **General Precautions**:
   - General precautions shall consist of a listing of equipment, conditions, and operational procedures considered necessary to maintain watertight integrity under normal ship operations (Ref: 4.22(3)).

4. **Specific Precautions**:
   - Specific precautions shall include a listing of elements (i.e., closures, security of stores, sounding of alarms, etc.) considered vital to the survival of the ship, passengers, and crew (Ref: 4.22(4)).

5. **Damage Stability Information**:
   - For ships to which damage stability requirements apply, damage stability information shall provide the master with a simple and easily understandable way of assessing the ship’s survivability in all damage cases involving a compartment or group of compartments (Ref: 4.22(5)).

This information is crucial for the officer in charge to effectively manage the ship's stability and respond to any flooding incidents.
