### QUESTION 2

**Question posée au LLM:**
> "According to REG Part B sections 4.3 and 4.4, under which conditions must a yacht be re-inclined, and what stability information must be amended?"

**Réponse complète du LLM:**

```
According to REG Yacht Code Part B, the conditions under which a yacht must be re-inclined and the stability information that must be amended are outlined in the following sections:

### Conditions for Re-inclining a Yacht
1. **Change in Vessel Particulars**: 
   - If a yacht undergoes repairs, alterations, modifications, or outfitting that substantially alters its dimensions or increases its service life, it shall be treated as a new vessel constructed on the date such alterations or modifications commenced (Ref: 4.30(5)).
   - Specifically, if the changes reach a new regulatory threshold (e.g., Gross Tonnage, Length), compliance with the relevant provisions applicable to a new vessel of that size is required (Ref: 4.30(5)).

2. **Compliance with Stability Criteria**:
   - The yacht must maintain sufficient intact stability under service conditions to withstand critical damage. This includes calculations that consider the worst anticipated service condition regarding stability (Ref: 4.30(5), 4.30(15)).

### Stability Information to be Amended
1. **Intact Stability Criteria**:
   - The yacht must retain the maximum among minimum required GM values or the minimum of maximum permissible KG values for each draft (Ref: 4.4).
   - If the subdivision index is calculated for different trims, several required GM curves must be established accordingly (Ref: 4.4).

2. **Data for the Master**:
   - The master of the yacht must be supplied with data necessary to maintain sufficient intact stability under service conditions. This includes information indicating the maximum permissible height of the ship's center of gravity above the keel (KG) or the minimum permissible metacentric height (GM) for a range of draughts or displacements (Ref: 4.30(16)).

3. **Draught Marks**:
   - Datum draught marks must be provided at the bow and stern, port and starboard, to assess the condition and trim of the vessel. These marks must be permanent and easily readable (Ref: 4.30(17)).

In summary, a yacht must be re-inclined if it undergoes significant alterations that affect its dimensions or service life, and the stability information must be updated to reflect the new stability criteria and provide necessary data to the master for maintaining stability.

### QUESTION 13

**Question posée au LLM:**
> "What are the requirements for stability in damaged condition?"

**Réponse complète du LLM:**

```
The requirements for stability in damaged condition are outlined in Section 4.30 of the REG Yacht Code. The key points are as follows:

1. **Intact Stability Requirements**:
   - Sufficient intact stability must be provided to withstand the final stage of flooding of any one main compartment within the floodable length (Ref: 4.30(1)).
   - If two adjacent main compartments are flooded, the intact stability must be adequate to withstand flooding of both compartments if they are separated by a stepped bulkhead (Ref: 4.30(2)).
   - For a required factor of subdivision between 0.5 and 0.33, stability must withstand flooding of any two adjacent main compartments (Ref: 4.30(3)).
   - For a required factor of subdivision of 0.33 or less, stability must withstand flooding of any three adjacent main compartments (Ref: 4.30(4)).

2. **Calculations for Stability**:
   - Stability calculations must consider the ship's proportions, design characteristics, and the arrangement of damaged compartments, assuming the worst anticipated service condition regarding stability (Ref: 4.30(5)).
   - If decks or bulkheads restrict water flow, the Administration must be satisfied that this is considered in the calculations (Ref: 4.30(6)).

3. **Residual Righting Lever Curve**:
   - After damage, the positive residual righting lever curve must have a minimum range of 15° beyond the angle of equilibrium, which can be reduced to 10° under certain conditions (Ref: 4.30(7)).
   - The area under the righting lever curve must be at least 0.015 metre-radians, measured from the angle of equilibrium to the angle at which flooding occurs or specified angles for flooding scenarios (Ref: 4.30(8)).

4. **Heeling Moments**:
   - The residual righting lever must account for heeling moments from passenger crowding, launching of survival craft, and wind pressure (Ref: 4.30(9)).
   - Specific assumptions for calculating heeling moments are provided, including passenger distribution and wind pressure application (Ref: 4.30(10)).

5. **Assumed Extent of Damage**:
   - The assumed extent of damage includes longitudinal, transverse, and vertical dimensions, with specific criteria based on the required factor of subdivision (Ref: 4.30(12)).

6. **Unsymmetrical Flooding**:
   - Provisions for unsymmetrical flooding include minimizing such flooding, ensuring self-acting means for correcting heel, and maintaining a maximum angle of heel after flooding (Ref: 4.30(13)).

7. **Final Conditions After Damage**:
   - For symmetrical flooding, a positive metacentric height of at least 50 mm is required; for unsymmetrical flooding, specific angles of heel are permitted (Ref: 4.30(14)).
   - The margin line must not be submerged in the final stage of flooding (Ref: 4.30(14)(c)).

8. **Master's Responsibilities**:
   - The master must be supplied with data necessary to maintain sufficient intact stability and be informed of conditions affecting stability (Ref: 4.30(15) and 4.30(16)).

9. **Draught Marks and Stability Verification**:
   - Draught marks must be provided for assessing the condition and trim of the vessel (Ref: 4.30(17)).
   - The master must determine the ship's trim and stability before departure, ensuring compliance with approved stability criteria (Ref: 4.30(20)).

10. **Relaxation of Requirements**:
    - Relaxations from damage stability requirements may only be considered in exceptional cases, with the Administration's satisfaction on the ship's stability characteristics (Ref: 4.30(21) and 4.30(22)).

These requirements ensure that a yacht maintains adequate stability under various conditions of damage, thereby enhancing safety for passengers and crew.

### QUESTION 22

**Question posée au LLM:**
> "What longitudinal, transverse, and vertical damage extents must be applied when assessing survivability in flooding scenarios?"

**Réponse complète du LLM:**

```
To assess survivability in flooding scenarios, the following damage extents must be applied based on the number of persons carried and the length of the yacht:

### Longitudinal Damage Extent
1. **For vessels carrying 400 or more persons:**
   - A damage length of **0.03L** (where L is the length of the ship) but not less than **3 metres** shall be assumed at any position along the side shell.
   
2. **For vessels carrying less than 400 persons:**
   - The damage length shall be assumed at any position along the shell side between transverse watertight bulkheads, provided that the distance between two adjacent transverse watertight bulkheads is not less than the assumed damage length. If the distance is less, only one of these bulkheads shall be considered effective.

3. **For vessels carrying 36 persons:**
   - A damage length of **0.015L** but not less than **3 metres** shall be assumed.

4. **For vessels carrying more than 36 but fewer than 400 persons:**
   - The values of damage length shall be obtained by linear interpolation between the values specified for ships carrying 36 persons and 400 persons.

### Transverse Damage Extent
- The transverse penetration inboard shall be assumed to be **0.1B** (where B is the breadth of the ship) but not less than **0.75 metres**, measured inboard from the ship side, at right angles to the centreline at the level of the deepest subdivision draught.

### Vertical Damage Extent
- The vertical extent of damage is to extend from the ship's moulded baseline to a position up to **12.5 metres** above the position of the deepest subdivision draft, unless a lesser vertical extent of damage gives a lower value of s (as defined in section 4.8(2)), in which case this reduced extent shall be used.

### Summary of Damage Extents
- **Longitudinal Damage:**
  - ≥ 400 persons: **0.03L** or **3m**
  - < 400 persons: Between bulkheads, distance ≥ damage length
  - 36 persons: **0.015L** or **3m**
  - 36 < persons < 400: Linear interpolation
- **Transverse Damage:** **0.1B** or **0.75m**
- **Vertical Damage:** Up to **12.5m** above the deepest subdivision draft

**References:**
- Longitudinal damage extents: Ref: 4.4(2)(b), 4.4(2)(c), 4.4(2)(d), 4.4(2)(e)

### QUESTION 23

**Question posée au LLM:**
> "What final conditions must the vessel meet after damage—metacentric height, heel angle, margin line—and how are these evaluated?"

**Réponse complète du LLM:**

```
The final conditions that a vessel must meet after damage, specifically regarding metacentric height, heel angle, and margin line, are outlined in the following sections:

1. **Metacentric Height (GZ Curve)**:
   - The angle of steady heel is determined by the intersection of a "derived wind heeling lever" curve with the GZ curve. This is essential for evaluating the stability of the vessel in a damaged condition (Ref: 4.30).
   - The GZ curve must be assessed at the down-flooding angle (θ) or 60°, whichever is least. If θ is less than 15°, the vessel is considered to have insufficient stability (Ref: 4.30).

2. **Heel Angle**:
   - The down-flooding angle (θ) is defined as the angle of heel that causes immersion of openings with an aggregate area greater than a specified value. All regularly used openings for access and ventilation must be considered when determining this angle. Openings leading to progressive flooding must not be immersed at an angle of heel of less than 40° (Ref: 4.30).

3. **Margin Line**:
   - The margin line is not explicitly defined in the provided extracts; however, it is implied that the vessel must maintain sufficient stability and integrity to prevent flooding beyond the margin line after damage. The stability calculations must ensure that the vessel can withstand the assumed extent of damage without compromising safety (Ref: 4.4, 4.30).

4. **Evaluation of Conditions**:
   - Compliance with stability requirements is demonstrated by ensuring that the attained subdivision index (s) is not less than 0.9 for the three loading conditions used to calculate the index A. This must also be satisfied for different trims (Ref: 4.4).
   - The damage extent to be assumed is dependent on the total number of persons carried and the length of the vessel (L). Specific damage lengths and penetrations are defined based on the number of persons on board, which must be considered in the stability calculations (Ref: 4.4).

In summary, the vessel must ensure adequate metacentric height and heel angle to maintain stability after damage, while the margin line must be respected to prevent flooding. These conditions are evaluated through stability calculations that consider the vessel's loading conditions, damage extent, and compliance with the subdivision index.
